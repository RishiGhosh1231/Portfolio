				<h3>I'm an Evolving Front End Web Developer</h3>
				<p>Hello, myself Rishi Ghosh. I am 18 years old and I completed my schooling from National Model School, Kolkata. Currently I am a web development student, pursuing specialization in JavaScript & CSS3, as well as learning ReactJS to enhance my front-end skills even more. Web designing and web developing has fascinated me from a very young age. 
                So far, I am well trained and expertized to design professional business websites and also some really cool and interactive websites. I am a fresher in this field and looking forward to new opportunities to gain more experience and explore myself. To choose something as your profession you must be passionate, and have urge to know something new every day and keep getting better at it, and thatâ€™s the exact reason why I chose to become a developer. I choose to learn all new things like a professional and I am always passionate and excited in the learning process. I am young and unrecognized but I positively look forward to grab all the opportunities that will come on my way. I am very professional and punctual about my projects and I expect my clients to equally cooperate with me. If your requirement is a responsive, interactive and a completely professional business website then you have found the right guy! You can contact me anytime to know more about my work and if interested in working with me. <br><br> <b>Note: This Portfolio website is made by me so you can get a little bit of basic idea of my development skills. </b></p>
